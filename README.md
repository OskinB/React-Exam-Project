# Final Exam Project 2020
I was the lead programmer for the final exam project at the Reykjavik Academy of Web Development, in which we collaborated with a software development company.<br>

This application gives you an overview of your belongings f.x. within a company. Each item has details such as; name, brand, purchase date, price, the quantity of each item, images, the current user of the item, and more. You can search for items and toggle between list- and grid view. You can add an item in a 3 step form, edit an item and delete it.<br> 
| Desktop and mobile view. <br>
Unfortunately, I don't have control over the database and server, so the project is not live. <br>
You can view a demo video below :

## Project setup
To start the project locally: 
  1. Clone or download the app
  2. Open a terminal in the root folder of the project
  3. Install the dependencies with the command `yarn`
  4. Then start the project with `yarn start`

## Project functionality
Since the project isn't connected to its database, there are limited actions you can take, and no data is available. 'Log in' page between the landing page and main page has been bypassed, but you can:
  * Check out the landing site (not available as mobile view)
  * In the navbar, press the 'Prufa frÃ­tt' button to go to the main page
  * On the main page (/bunadarskra), you can see the layout without data

## Stack
Built with React, Xstate, and Sass.
