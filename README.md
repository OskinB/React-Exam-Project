# üóÉÔ∏è Final Exam Project 2020
I was the lead programmer for the final exam project at the Reykjavik Academy of Web Development, in which we collaborated with a software development company.<br>

This application gives you an overview of your belongings f.x. within a company. Each item has details such as; name, brand, purchase date, price, the quantity of each item, images, the current user of the item, and more. You can search for items and toggle between list- and grid view. You can add an item in a 3 step form, edit an item and delete it.<br> 
> Desktop and mobile view.<br>

Unfortunately, I don't have a database, so the project is not live but you can view a demo video here:
